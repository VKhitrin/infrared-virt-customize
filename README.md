# Infrared virt-customize plugin

**This is a POC**, if you're part of RedHat, contribute to the [design sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/142VmEXXUblwVXF249ZX0PhT8ZC2vQ-2NYSJopMFyiIk).

Notes:

* No linting is being done at the moment

* Due to infrared's design, works only on RHEL and Fedora

* Not optimized to the way infrared works with variables at the moment

* Assumes you have an undercloud node (OpenStack undercloud is deployed via infrared), no local and or remote node execution at the moment

* Assumes that the user stack on undercloud node has rw permissions to guest disk image

* Assumes repos are configured on guest disk image

## Description
